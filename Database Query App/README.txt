This project was a collaboration between me and Moulin Chandrakant Jariwala.

The objective was to write a series of web applications that would take an input, 
use said input to pull up data from a particular database, and present it in a table.

I wrote the back-end code in Python using modules to interpret SQL commands. The front-end
code was done by Moulin.
